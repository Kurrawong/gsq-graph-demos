= Observations to Feature Properties Demo

This demonstration creates some simple Observations, Results, Samples and Features data, enhances it with a couple of small "build" queries and then indicates properties for Features, based on properties for which there are results from Observations.

All the .sparql files in this demo are SPARQL queries files that should be run in number order, 1-..., 2-... etc. on an empty RDF Database with a SPARQL Endpoint. All the data needed is created within the queries.

Each SPARQL query tells you what it does in comments at the top of the file.
